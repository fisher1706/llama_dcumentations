The 13th Amendment abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime. The 14th Amendment defined citizenship, ensured equal protection under the law, and addressed representation and debt obligations.\n\n**Three Questions with Specific Answers:**\n\n1. **What were the exact dates of passage and ratification for the 13th and 14th Amendments to the United States Constitution?**\n\n   - The 13th Amendment was passed by Congress on January 31, 1865, and ratified on December 6, 1865.\n   - The 14th Amendment was passed by Congress on June 13, 1866, and ratified on July 9, 1868.\n\n2. **How did the 14th Amendment redefine the basis of representation in Congress for states that denied voting rights to male citizens?**\n\n   - According to Section 2 of the 14th Amendment, if a state denied the right to vote to any male inhabitants who were 21 years of age and citizens of the United States (except for participation in rebellion or other crime), the basis of representation for that state in Congress would be reduced in proportion to the number of such male citizens to the whole number of male citizens 21 years of age in that state.\n\n3. **What conditions must be met for a person who engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the United States to hold public office again?**\n\n   - As per Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, a person who previously took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States but then engaged in insurrection or rebellion (or gave aid or comfort to enemies) can have their eligibility for public office restored if Congress votes to remove this disability with a two-thirds majority in each House.\n\n**Higher-Level Summary and Additional Questions:** The Reconstruction Amendments (13th and 14th) were critical in reshaping the United States' legal and social landscape, particularly concerning issues of slavery, citizenship, and equal protection under the law. These amendments were enacted during a period of significant national change and aimed to establish fundamental rights and redefine the nation's approach to governance and individual freedoms.\n\n- **What were the primary objectives of the 13th and 14th Amendments?**\n\n  - The 13th Amendment aimed to abolish slavery and involuntary servitude.\n  - The 14th Amendment sought to define citizenship, ensure states could not abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens, and guarantee equal protection under the law.\n\n- **How did these amendments modify existing parts of the Constitution?**\n\n  - They modified Article IV, Section 2, and Article I, Section 2, respectively, directly impacting how the nation viewed slavery, citizenship, and representation."}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "b5c797e9-c161-478f-af87-750a92b6a789", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "constitution.pdf", "file_path": "C:\\Users\\OLAZEBA\\PycharmProjects\\llama_dcumentations\\data_one\\constitution.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 413949, "creation_date": "2025-10-09", "last_modified_date": "2025-10-09"}, "hash": "d057ac9ed58b21b67ae4ac03fff109fd230be538499ded940d7668004c0114df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "C O N S T I T U T I O N O F T H E U N I T E D S T A T E S  \nAmendment  XIII. \nPassed by Congress January 31, 1865.
